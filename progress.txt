I finished the connect header parsing to get https to work, but for 
some other reason, https requests aren't working yet. I'll take a look
at why sometime tomorrow.

Other than that, I also finished a few other header fields to get
http/1.1 to work, so most http websites will work now.

The next step probably is to get multiple connections working at the same time.

I'm using a makefile to build it. You can run make test to execute the test
script. Right now it has two tests in it, the first is to an http website,
and the other is to an https website. The https is commented out though.

There's another executable for a client, but I was using that to test it
right in the beginning. It doesn't do anything as of now. Let me know
if you have any questions.

parseHeader() wasn't parsing the port correctly so I fixed that.

I made it so that the server can handle multiple clients. This was done through
the epoll API. I didn't change any of the program flow for handling a request
from a client; I simply ported them into a loop where it handles detection
from clients through the epoll instance. I used poll initially but learned that
epoll is quicker and has similar API.

All the changes were done in main(), except one line in parseHeader(). Macros
were added for MAX_EVENTS (for the max number of client requests to handle at a
time) and LOOP_SIZE (the outermost loop, should theoretically infinite, but for
developing purposes we can limit)

Changed indentation and limited (most) lines to 80. If you don't like 80-column
limit, feel free to change it! I'm still looking at the socket HTTPS
