I finished the connect header parsing to get https to work, but for 
some other reason, https requests aren't working yet. I'll take a look
at why sometime tomorrow.

Other than that, I also finished a few other header fields to get
http/1.1 to work, so most http websites will work now.

The next step probably is to get multiple connections working at the same time.

I'm using a makefile to build it. You can run make test to execute the test
script. Right now it has two tests in it, the first is to an http website,
and the other is to an https website. The https is commented out though.

There's another executable for a client, but I was using that to test it
right in the beginning. It doesn't do anything as of now. Let me know
if you have any questions.
